    <h1>This Is My Truth</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">
      This wasn’t made on impulse —  
      it was made because my heart kept choosing you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to move beyond friendship,  
      into something close, deep, and real —  
      where you can tell me anything,  
      and I’ll still remember it days later.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t want you just for a date on the 14th.  
      I want ordinary days, quiet nights,  
      and months that slowly blur into years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to know your birthday,  
      your interests, your hobbies —  
      and not just know them, but love them with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You give me the feeling  
      that makes me want to build a life,  
      not just moments.
    </p>

    <div class="verse">
      “Love is patient, love is kind.  
      It does not envy, it does not boast.”  
      <span>— 1 Corinthians 13:4</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      I want to be gentle with your heart,  
      steady with my words,  
      and intentional with my love.
    </p>

    <div class="verse">
      “Many waters cannot quench love;  
      rivers cannot sweep it away.”  
      <span>— Song of Solomon 8:7</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      And if our souls were ever scattered across galaxies,  
      I would still look for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because even the stars,  
      in all their endless light,  
      are jealous of you.
    </p>
